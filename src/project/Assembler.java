	  * is returned as the value of the method. 
	  * A return value of 0 indicates that the code had no errors 
	  * and an output file was produced and saved. If the input or 
	  * output cannot be opened, the return value is -1.
	  * The unchecked exception IllegalArgumentException is thrown 
	  * if the error parameter is null, since it would not be 
	  * possible to provide error information about the source code.
	  * @param inputFileName the source assembly language file name
	  * @param outputFileName the file name of the executable version  
	  * of the program if the source program is correctly formatted
	  * @param error the StringBuilder to store the description 
	  * of the error or errors reported. It will be empty (length 
	  * zero) if no error is found.
	  * @return 0 if the source code is correct and the executable 
	  * is saved, -1 if the input or output files cannot be opened, 
	  * otherwise the line number of a reported error.
